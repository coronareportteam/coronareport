[[agent.cases]]
== Managing cases

[[agent.cases.occasions]]
=== Creating occasions

When tracking down contacts for a case, the tracked person might report having been to a restaurant, attended a family gathering or the like.
To capture contact information for people that attended those occasions, the occasions can be registered for a given case.

An occasion can be created by posting to `/hd/cases/{id}/occasions`, expanding the template with a case identifier.

The request takes the following properties:

include::{snippets}/create-occasions/create-occasion/auto-request-fields.adoc[]

The response will contain an 8-digit `occasionCode` that's supposed to be handed out to location owners and potentially third party APIs to submit visitor groups for that occasion.
See <<third-party.visitor-groups>> for details.

[[agent.anomalies]]
== Working with anomalies

A case agent will find a `anomalies` link in the response.
It can be followed to get an overview of all cases ordered by a priority calculated from the anomalies recorded for those cases.
