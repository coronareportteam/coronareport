This section contains the documentation for the Quarano REST API for tracking people, health department staff, administrators and third-party integrators.

[[fundamentals]]
== Fundamentals

[[fundamentals.hypermedia]]
=== Use of hypermedia

The Quarano REST API makes use of hypermedia elements in its responses to guide clients through business processes, indicate the availability of related resources and actions.
Clients are encouraged to make use of those control to signal that availability to users via UI controls and use the metadata exposed via the API to avoid semantic coupling to the representations.
The media type we use as foundation of our representations is http://stateless.co/hal_specification.html[HAL].

[[authentication]]
== Authentication

The Quarano REST API uses JWT token based authentication.
To authenticate with Quarano, access the API root resource and follow the `login` link returned.

include::{snippets}/root-resource/access-root-resource/curl-request.adoc[]

The login resource takes a `username` and `password` field

include::{snippets}/getting-started/login/curl-request.adoc[]

A successful login will contain an `X-Auth-Token` header.

include::{snippets}/getting-started/login/http-response.adoc[]

That token can be used to authenticate subsequent requests by including an `Authorization` header with the value `Bearer: $TOKEN`.
Also, the response will contain a simple `next` link to point to which resource access to gather information about the currently logged in user, navigation options, etc.
However, in case a password is expired, there'll also appear a `change-password` link pointing to a resource to change the password to a new one.
At this point, clients should not allow any other operation than changing the password.

include::{snippets}/password-expired/login/links.adoc[]

[[authentication.error-scenarios]]
=== Error scenarios

As the login may fail for a variety of reasons, the resource returns different HTTP status codes in case of failures:

* `401 Unauthorized` -- if the given credentials are invalid.
* `403 Forbidden` -- in case the account's associated case fails to meet additional business requirements.

In all cases, the response contains a human readable message to display to the user in `text/plain` format.

[[authentication.change-password]]
=== Changing the password

The necessity to change a users password will be indicated by a `change-password` link available in the response of a successful login.
To change the password, issue a request to the links target URI submitting the new password and the just returned authentication token:

include::{snippets}/password-expired/change-password/curl-request.adoc[]

The request takes the following attributes:

include::{snippets}/password-expired/change-password/auto-request-fields.adoc[]

[[authentication.password-reset]]
=== Resetting the password

A user can set a password request by following the `reset-password` link relation returned by the root resource.

include::{snippets}/password-reset/access-root-resource/curl-request.adoc[]
include::{snippets}/password-reset/access-root-resource/response-body.adoc[]
include::{snippets}/password-reset/access-root-resource/links.adoc[]

We can now follow that link and issue a `POST` request to it, to request a reset of our password:

include::{snippets}/password-reset/request-reset/curl-request.adoc[]
include::{snippets}/password-reset/request-reset/auto-request-fields.adoc[]

If that request is successful, an email containing a link to the user interface will be sent out to the email address just given.

include::{snippets}/password-reset/request-reset/response-body.adoc[]
include::{snippets}/password-reset/request-reset/links.adoc[]

Also, the password can be finally reset by following the `reset-password` link in turn, providing additional information.

include::{snippets}/password-reset/perform-reset/curl-request.adoc[]
include::{snippets}/password-reset/perform-reset/auto-request-fields.adoc[]

A successful reset will be confirmed by an HTTP `200 OK` as well as a link pointing to the login resource.

include::{snippets}/password-reset/perform-reset/response-body.adoc[]


[[user-details]]
== User details

After the login, resources available are advertised via the user details resource.
The response of the login request points to that in the `next` link.
Depending on the role of the logged in user, you'll find different links within that representation.
For example, a case agent will see the following links.

include::{snippets}/getting-started/agent-user-home/links.adoc[]

include::api-agent.adoc[leveloffset=+1]
include::api-user.adoc[leveloffset=+1]
include::api-third-party.adoc[leveloffset=+1]

[[actuators]]
== Actuators

Quarano uses Spring Boot actuators to expose technical and health information about the running instance.
The most interesting ones are:

* `/actuator/health`
* `/actuator/info`

[[actuators.development]]
=== Development APIs

When an application is built using the `localDev` profile, it can be run with the `develop` profile activated and will expose additional actuator endpoints.
One use case for those APIs is resetting the application during end-to-end integration tests.
The following HTTP resources come in handy for that:

* `GET /actuator/health/readiness` -- Exposing whether the application is ready to serve requests.
* `POST /actuator/restart` -- Triggering an application restart that will reset the database to it's original state containing demo data.

NOTE: The latter actuator is *only* available if the application is built and run with the `localDev` and `develop` Spring profile.
Actual deployments will never actually activate those profiles so that we can't trigger that database reset by accident.

To prepare a Quarano instance for such activities build and start the application as follows:

[source, bash]
----
# Build the JAR skipping the tests for speedup
$ ./mvnw clean package -PlocalDev -DskipTests
…
# Run the app with the develop profile enabled (in-memory database and email server enabled)
$ java -Dspring.profiles.active=develop target/*.jar
----

A client could then trigger an HTTP POST to `/actuator/restart` (you need an authentication token for that) and then poll `/actuator/health/readiness` until `$.status` in the JSON response returns `UP`.
It can then proceed with requests that assume the default demo data state.
Repeat as needed after operations that have changed the application state in way that it'd taint further interactions.
